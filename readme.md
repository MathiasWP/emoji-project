# The Emoji Project.

üëã and welcome to the emoji project!

The Emoji Project serves one purpose: Giving web-developers of all skill-levels inspirations for projects they create!

The Emoji Project is open-source and purely created by submits from people like you ü§ù‚ù§Ô∏è

### To submit an emoji, do one of the two;

1. Create an issue and submit your emoji there.

2. Do a pull-request of the repo, insert your submission into the `emojis.json` file, and then afterwards submit your change as a pull-request.

### Information needed to submit an emoji project (follow this template):

```
{
  "emoji": "üé∞",
  "name": "slot machine",
  "category": "Activities",
  "aliases": ["slot_machine"],
  "tags": ["HTML", "CSS", "JavaScript", "Game"],
  "languages": ["HTML", "CSS", "JavaScript"],
  "difficulty": "medium",
  "project_description": "Create a slot-machine from scratch with HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript. Bonus points if you include the usage of currency in your slot-machine.",
  "project_tips": "Use the Math.random() function to randomly loop through the different slots."
}
```

**NOTE:** Do NOT change the "emoji", "name", "category" or "aliases" properties. Your submission will not be accepted if you do. Also do not re-submit an already created project.

### What the different properties must include:

- Tags: Some tags explaining what the project is about.
- Languages: The programming-languages used in the project.
- Difficulty: The skill-level required for the challenge. Try to be as objective as possible.
- Project description: A text explaining what the project should be.
- Project tips (voluntary): In case you want to give some tips for programming the project.
